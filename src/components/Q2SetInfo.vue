      <p><b>Quasar 2: <em>Singularity</em></b> is a large set designed for both limited and constructed, and the last of two sets in the <b>Quasar</b> block. Like QSR, Q2S is meant to be played in isolation, although it will be backwards compatible with the mechanics and effects from QSR, as well as have a lesser overall degree of parasitism.</p>

      <p>While QSR's mechanical identity revolved around activated abilities, <b><em>Singularity</em></b> is more focused on exploring some of the more out-there design space that the game has to offer. For this purpose, very few things are considered off-limits, but the set won't contain any changes to the core MtG rules. As with QSR, all mechanics will be designed within the limits of physical cards, and may feature several card wording changes, for both aesthetic and functional purposes. <em class="shadow">(Down with the tyranny of CARDNAME!)</em></p>

      <p>Q2S will keep Quasar's color identities <em>( <i class="ms ms-r ms-cost ms-shadow"></i> ritual ramp, evasive aggro <i class="ms ms-u ms-cost ms-shadow"></i> etc. )</em>, as well as feature mechanics that are equally viable and present in all colors. Unlike QSR, however, Q2S is a <b>+1/+1 counter</b> set, with all the pros and cons of that approach. <em class="shadow">(One of which, unfortunately, is increased tracking complexity when played alongside QSR due to the latter's leveling permanents.)</em></p>

      <p>Because of the nature of Q2S's story <em class="shadow">(more details soonâ„¢)</em>, a large part of the set's flavor, and potentially mechanics, will be about visiting/travelling to other planes. Because of this:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><b><em>If you have a custom set/setting and want your plane featured in this set, please let me know*.</em></b></p>
      
      <p class="shadow">*Server veterans might remember the last time I tried to do something like this. Hopefully I get it right this time around.</p>

      <p>To me, one of the biggest things about the original set was the community surrounding it. Completing QSR wouldn't have been possible without all the help and feedback people have provided over the years. At the time of writing, Q2S doesn't yet have a set channel, but I'll try to get one as soon as possible. Discussion will most likely reside in <b>#project-design</b> and card designs will be posted in <b>#custom-design</b> until then.</p>

      <p>If anyone wants to get more familiar with the original set, you can find more info <a href="https://xordesigns.github.io">here</a>. Also, you can give yourself the <b>'quasar'</b> role on the server if you want to host or participate in QSR drafts, which are still happening from time to time.</p>

      <p>This page, as well as the set's Planesculptors page, will be updated as set mechanics and flavor are solidified. Until then, stay safe, have fun, and don't accidentally trip over the event horizon!</p>
