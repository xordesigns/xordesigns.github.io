        <p>QSR doesn't have a focus on multicolor, nor does it have a focus on monocolor. Players are free to mix and match as they see fit, as there are no traditional 2-color archetypes, but should keep in mind that color weight is used as a point of balance in the card design <i>(i.e. 5C goodstuff might not take you very far, but feel free to experiment)</i>.</p>

        <h1>LIMITED</h1>

        <p><b>Quasar</b> limited is pretty normal, with one fairly important change: <b>there are no explicit limited archetypes</b>. What this means is that rather than have specific archetypes for the 2-color combinations, the multicolor cards in the set (specifically the uncommons) are created in a way that supports the core strategy of each of the individual colors of the card.</p>
        <p>A <i class="ms ms-gu ms-cost ms-shadow"></i> card has effects that support both <i class="ms ms-u ms-cost ms-shadow"></i>'s evasive aggro gameplay style, and <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost ms-shadow"></i>'s go-wide gameplay, while not creating some unique strategy for that color combination. In a way, this is designed to really let players pick what they want and have that work within reason. QSR is a very casual set, and as such players are encouraged to build decks around what they think is cool and exciting, and just promote an atmosphere of general kitchen-table fun.</p>
