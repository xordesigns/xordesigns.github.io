However, when their veil of secrecy is breached, the flames of galactic war finally ignite. Outnumbered and outgunned, SEERE rely on their information and infiltration capabilities to control the galactic battlefield, delivering swift, critical strikes that cripple the enemy forces and turn the tides of battle in their favor.",
